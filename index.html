          <p>The World Wide Web as we know it today is our essential way to communicate, maintain business, shop, and entertainment hasn’t always been so readily available to every user worldwide. With accessible opportunities and faster communication, the evolution of the internet can be described in two main phases: its development from a military experiment to a civilian utilization, and the commercialization of the network. has been influenced by researchers and scientists. The internet was created through many people, just one single person. The origins of the internet are rooted in the USA’s engagement in the Cold War with the Soviet Union (CFR Education, 2023). Each country is working to enhance its science and technology capabilities to prevent nuclear attacks from the other.   The internet was a prototype used by the United States Government more than 50 years ago to share data and communicate between themselves (Insight, 2023).  In its first phase, the internet was born as a computer networking experiment by the US Department of Defense in the late 1960s. </p>
          <hr>
          <p> The internet was thought of as a concept of the packet switching theory.  The approach was published as ARPNET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) titled “Information Flow in Large Communication Nets” in 1961, written by Leonard Kleinrock. The internet began as ARPNET, an academic research network supported by the military’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, now DARPA). Based and connected to four university computer science departments in California, Los Angeles, and Stanford University. Along with J.C.R Licklider, the first director of the Information Processing Technology Office (IPTO), provided the backbone for the network of connected computers. In 1969, Thomas Merrill and Lawrence Roberts created the first computer networking telephone lines. ARPNET was decentralized and safe from attack. But as the network expanded to more places and more users it became more difficult to maintain security. It created the TCP/IP communications standard (defines data transfers on the internet today).  Over time, the internet has evolved into a global communication tool. </p>
          <hr>
          <p>The 1970s pivoted the way the internet, the public, and integration would influence the way computers connected, and computer networks grew together. As ARPNET remained a secret Defense Department project. This was still a breakthrough year for the “internet of things” or “network to network” because of the breakthrough in concepts and protocols such as, the first Atlantic-International Connection and TCP/IP Communications (TTH, 2023). TCP/IP became known as the backbone of the internet, offering a standardized and universal accepted method for different networks to communicate seamlessly (TTH, 2023). Packet switching and TCP/IP involved the innovation of breaking data into packets for efficient transmission over the network, enabling faster and more reliable communications.</p>
          <hr>
          <p> As ARPNET grew it became more difficult to maintain, prompting the US government security concerns of who was using it and what were they doing. As the facilitation of the development of the internet evolved the interconnection of multiple computers within the same space gave rise to the Local Area Networks (LANs), still in 2024 it is important to the way we conduct our everyday lives as consumers and enterprises. The first email system in ARPNET would be another key point in the in the process facilitating efficient and standardized communication over the internet, laying the groundwork for the expansive and interconnected digital communication landscape we experience today (THT, 2023). The technologies that brought ARPNET to life were the TCP/IP protocol, interface message processors (IMPs), packet-switched networks. The evolution of ARPNET to internet has revolutionized networks, wireless networks, mechanics, robotics, science, and to the public communicating collectively (Contribution, 2009). </p>

          <p>When Tim Berners-Lee developed the World Wide Web, he started hosting public pages on private servers in 1989, he made the earliest version of the web standards we rely on today. In 1994, Tim founded the W3C, an international committee made up of member organizations (business, nonprofit, governmental entities, and so on) to internally develop and improve web-based technologies (Webflow, 2014).  Web standards are a set of practical guidelines to ensure the web is accessible to everyone. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) also contributed to the first web standards. It specializes in formalizing solutions to global challenges, such as environmental, health, safety, and energy management standards. It also identifies international standards across industries, including some aspects of the web (Webflow, 2014). Web standards were created to keep a constant formal webpage uploading throughout the web and maintain ethical standards. </p>
          <hr>
          <p>The first three web standards:</p>
          <pre>•	HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
•	Uniform Resource Identifier (URL) 
•	Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) </pre>
          <p>The varied and evolved web standards:</p>
          <pre>•	Decentralization: Anyone can post anything online without explicit permission from a governing body.
•	Nondiscrimination (net neutrality): The same level of communication should exist across platforms, no matter how good or bad the internet service is.
•	Bottom-up design: Code should be developed publicly, encouraging collaboration and experimentation.
•	Universality: All computers should speak the same language, no matter where they’re located or who’s controlling them.
•	Consensus: Everyone involved in the technical aspects of the web must agree to use web standards. </pre>
          <p>The Common Web Standards:</p>
          <pre>•	HTML
•	XML
•	XHTML
•	CSS
•	WCAG2.0 </pre>
          <p> Web standards benefit both the people who use the web and those who are behind building and keeping it afloat. To the web standards, standard to follow the WCAG guidelines should improve search engine results and accessibility while supporting evolving technology and design flexibility. Keeping web standards implemented are listed a such: </p>
          <pre>•	Web search visibility: Web standards make sure sites are easily indexed and search engines such as Google.
•	Accessibility: HTML accessible options and WCAG’s guidelines help as many people as possible effectively use the web. 
•	 Design Flexibility: CSS reduces web design size across devices and increases loading speed by sitting separately from the website code. </pre>
          <hr>
          <p>Explanation of the following concepts and how they relate to Web site design and development:</p>
          <pre>            <p>•	Graceful degradation: </p> o	Graceful degradation is a design that is a principle in web development where a website is built to make sure that it remains functional even if certain features are not supported by the user's browser or device. 
•	Fully featured website approach and still providing a basic level of functionality and usability.
•	It’s important because it helps ensure that users with older browsers or devices can still access and use the website. <p>•	Progressive enhancement/Adaptive Web design: </p> o	Progressive enhancement starts with a basic version of a website that works on all devices and browsers, while adding more advanced features for users with modern browsers or devices that support them. 
o	Adaptive web design is a related concept that involves designing websites to adapt to the capabilities of the user's device or browser.	
•	Entrusting the progressive approach can support that all users can access the core content and functionality of the website, while also providing enhanced experiences for users with more compatible capable devices. 
•	Adaptive web design focuses on flexible layouts and designs that can adjust to different screen sizes, resolutions, and input methods.
•	 Both progressive enhancement and adaptive web design are important in modern web development because they help support functioning websites are accessible and usable widely across a range of devices and browsers, from desktop computers to smartphones and tablets. <p>•	Responsive Web design:</p> o	Responsive web design is an approach to web development that includes creating websites that can adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions and can be achieved using CSS media queries to adjust the layout and design of the website. 
•	Responsive web design is essential for websites so they’re accessible and usable on a wide range of devices.
•	 Responsive designs can provide a consistent user experience across different devices without the need for separate mobile or desktop versions of the site. <p>•	Mobile first Web design:</p> o	Mobile-first web design starts with the mobile version of a website and then progresses to enhancing the design to fit larger screens and recognizes the increasing priority of the importance of mobile devices in web browsing (especially when designing websites).	
•	 With a mobile-first approach, developers can make sure that the site is optimized for smaller screens and touch-based interactions.
•	Faster load times, improved performance, and better overall user experience on mobile devices. <p>•	Future-friendly:</p> o	Future-friendly web design is a design philosophy that creates websites that are adaptable and resilient to future changes in technology and use’s trend behavior. 
•	This helps to extend the lifespan of websites and reduce the need for frequent redesigns or updates.
•	 Web design and development are important to help make sure that websites are accessible, usable, and adaptable across different devices, browsers, and technologies.
